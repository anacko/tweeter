# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Departing from a starter code, continuing this project required HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills.

It presents previous posts and enables the user to make a new post, limit to 140 characters. Highly interactive, other features include the interface to present the new-tweet interface just upon requisition, validation for empty or too long messages, a button that appears when the page is scrolled down and brings the page to its top, and two different layouts, for vertical and wide screens.

## Making new tweets

In vertical position...
